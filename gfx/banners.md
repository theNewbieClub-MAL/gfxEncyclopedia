## Heading banner

### About heading

The headline or heading is the text indicating the nature of the article below it.

<!--It is sometimes termed a news hed, a deliberate misspelling that dates from production flow
during hot type days, to notify the composing room that a written note from an editor concerned
a headline and should not be set in type.-->

Headlines in English often use a set of grammatical rules known as *headlinese*, designed to meet
stringent space requirements by, for example, leaving out forms of the verb "to be" and choosing
short verbs like "eye" over longer synonyms like "consider."<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>
