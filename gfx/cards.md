# Card Editions

## About cards

Cards or card editions are a club thing that don’t serve a real purpose, but are rather collectibles that you can for example just save, show off in a blog post on MAL such as in this example here, or display them in your MAL profile, your forum signature, etc. <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

We don't have a definite answer on how it became a thing but it's in a lot of other clubs as well. This is just one of them.
Graphic designers use programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Krita, GIMP, and Paint.NET (or any editing program) to make cards.

Members collect them for these vary reasons:

1. Show off in a blog.
2. The sake of having a collection.
3. Admire the cards made by different designers.

The card design you will get is same as what you requested with your username in it.<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>

## How edition work

Each month we vote on the editions the team will do, deadlines for these will be set and cards/banners need to be submitted on time otherwise they will not be included in the edition.

Once everything is submitted, they are added onto the edition thread which then goes live to the TNC community. The edition closes when the close date arrives OR if the request limit is met.

All edition requests will be added to our card requests spreadsheet.

## Requirement for creating cards
