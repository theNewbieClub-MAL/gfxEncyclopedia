# Layout Designing

## How club layouts work

The Newbie Club, like most MAL clubs, will have a layout on our MyAnimeList homepage. This acts as a welcome and directory/index of club to people coming into the club space.
The theme for these layouts changes frequently, *so we always need new layouts made*, based on the time of year i.e., Christmas, Halloween, or to show a certain anime/season… such as this summer layout shown below. Changing the layout regularly helps keep the club face fresh and exciting.

When you make a club layout, you are not just making a basic club layout but a complete matching set of:

* [MAL Club Layout](#mal-club-layout),
* [MAL Club Profile Picture](#mal-club-profile-picture),
* Discord Server Icon
* Discord Invite Banner
* Discord Server Banner
