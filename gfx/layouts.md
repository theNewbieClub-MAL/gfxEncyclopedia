# Layout Designing

## How club layouts work

The Newbie Club, like most MAL clubs, will have a layout on our MyAnimeList homepage. This acts as a
welcome and directory/index of club to people coming into the club space.

The theme for these layouts changes frequently, *so we always need new layouts made*, based on the
time of year i.e., Christmas, Halloween, or to show a certain anime/season. Changing the layout
regularly helps keep the club face fresh and exciting.

When you make a club layout, you are not just making a basic club layout but a complete
matching set of:

* [MAL Club Layout](#mal-club-layout),
* [MAL Club Profile Picture](#mal-club-profile-picture),
* Discord Server Icon
* Discord Invite Banner
* Discord Server Banner
